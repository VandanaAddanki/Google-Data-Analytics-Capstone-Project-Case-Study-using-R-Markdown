This is a Google Data Analytics capstone project. The case study 1 with the title is "How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?". In this case study, we will follow the six-step Data Analysis Process, i.e. Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. Here I'll be using RStudio to clean, manipulate and analyze data. I documented everything via R Markdown.
